# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **BRIAN**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Summary

**and1p5ownadventureapi** app is an Android app that displays random images of animals from various public APIs.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **üì± üê∂ üê±**

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [ X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [ X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [ X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [X ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is:

** https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random**.
** https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search?limit=10 **.
** https://randomfox.ca/floof/?ref=apilist.fun **.

## Notes

During the development process, I encountered some challenges with effectively managing the asynchronous API calls and updating the UI accordingly. However, implementing the AsyncHTTPClient library helped streamline this process significantly.

One of the design choices was to keep the UI simple and user-friendly, focusing on the display of animal images as the primary feature. This decision was made to ensure a seamless and intuitive user experience.

This project provided valuable insights into handling multiple API requests in an Android application and effectively managing the retrieval and display of data from different sources.

In future iterations, it would be beneficial to implement a more dynamic user interface, allowing users to interact with the app by inputting specific queries to customize the type of animal images they want to see.

Overall, this project served as an excellent learning experience, enhancing my understanding of integrating APIs into Android applications and reinforcing my knowledge of asynchronous programming techniques in Kotlin.
